# Twitter Clone

[Live Demo](https://twitter-clone-l5uy7nkp4-ren0xx.vercel.app) :point_left:

I created this Twitter clone to learn as much as I could about Next.js, Typescript, and other technologies. As a beginner Typescript user, I wanted to challenge myself and build something substantial. This is my first project using Next.js. I used Firebase as the backend for my application and deployed it on Vercel.
## Built with:
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
-   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [Formik](https://formik.org)
-   [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
-   [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
-   [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)

Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
